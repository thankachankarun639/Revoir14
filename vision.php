 <p>Objectives of Revoir '14 are: </p>
 <ul>
 <li>Formal get together for the 2008 passout batch of CSED.</li>
 <li>Strengthening the Alumni network of the department.</li>
 <li>Seeking suggestions from alumni for internships, placements and higher studies.</li>
 <li>Seeking suggestions on the CSE curriculum at NITC.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Having a strong alumni network will help the alumni and students to stay in touch with each other and advance in their careers while being aware of what's happening in the industry and academia. This will not only help improve the standards of professionalism of the students but also inculcate in them a helping mentality to their juniors as well. Above all, it will help the alumni to reconnect with their old friends and also connect with the present batches which will be beneficial for students, alumni and the department.
